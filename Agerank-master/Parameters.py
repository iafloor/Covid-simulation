P_QUARANTINE = 0.9  # probability of a person with symptoms going into

P_TRANSMIT0 = 0.2  # probability of becoming a transmitter of the disease

# For now, neglected. The others are assumed to be the oldest.
VACC = 0.005  # fraction of the population vaccinated per day.
# The vaccination is assumed to have immediate effect, modelling
# receiving the shot two weeks earlier.
# Only susceptible persons are vaccinated.

# The value is based on 100000 first doses per day.
STARTAGE = 18  # starting age of the vaccination, country dependent (NL 18, IL 16)

PERIOD = 6  # number of days for which the contacts are the same group.

# persons, # and 30 (all monthly contacts are with the same person).
# A period of 6 seems a good compromise.
RATIO_HF = 3  # ratio between number of admissions to the hospital
# and the number of fatalities (ratio must be >=1)
# this does not influence the simulation, as the age-dependence
# of hospitalisation has been modelled through the fatality rate.
